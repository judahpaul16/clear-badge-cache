Clear Badge Cache is a tool designed to purge cached GitHub badge images. Based on the repository URL and badge file, it will delete the cached image from the GitHub CDN.

Inspired by [github-badge-cache-buster](https://github.com/sbts/github-badge-cache-buster)

## Quick Start üöÄ

### Prerequisites üìã

- Go (1.22.2 or later)

*Don't want to install Go? No worries; you can use the pre-built binaries in the `dist` directory using the same arguments as the Go program.*

### Installation üõ†

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd clear-badge-cache
   ```
3. Run the go file directly with or without arguments:

   ```bash
   go run main.go [repoURL] [badgeFile]
   ```

   If no arguments are provided, the program will prompt you to enter the repository URL.
Ô∏è

### Building üî®

Run the appropriate build script from the `build-scripts` directory for your operating system:

- For Linux or MacOS, open your terminal and run:

  ```bash
  ./build-scripts/build.sh
  ```

- For Windows, run the following in Command Prompt or PowerShell:

  ```cmd
  .\build-scripts\build.bat
  ```

This will compile the source code and produce an executable in the `dist` directory.

### Running üèÉ

To run Clear Badge Cache, navigate to the `dist` directory and execute the binary:

- Linux/MacOS:

  ```bash
  sh ./clear-badge-cache.sh
  ```
- Windows:

  ```cmd
  .\clear-badge-cache.exe
  ```

#### Command Line Arguments üñäÔ∏è

You can provide the repository URL and optionally a badge file as command-line arguments:

```bash
clear-badge-cache [repoURL] [badgeFile]
```

If no arguments are provided, the program will prompt you to enter the repository URL.

#### Help

To display the help message, use the `-h` or `--help` flag:

```bash
clear-badge-cache -h
```

The help message is as follows:

```
usage: clear-badge-cache [ -h | --help | [ repoURL [ badgeFile ] ] ]

       repoURL   required unless provided on command line
       badgeFile defaults to ''
```
